/**
 *  Class for validating that a URL with a JWT in the query string conforms to a URL scheme as defined by 
 *  SecureUrlSchemeConfig.plist file. Validations include: JWT signature is valid, payload includes
 *  a timestamp that is within the acceptable age (usually seconds), payload includes a user name that 
 *  is the same as the user currently logged in, the URL host is one of the verbs accepted by the scheme,
 *  and that the application that sent the URL is white listed as an acceptable source.
 *
 *  Usage is to initWithUrlReceived:options: then confirm with isValid before carrying out the action indicated by the 
 *  URL. After being initialized and validated, the verb (host portion of URL) will be populated and the app can then
 *  proceed to act on it.
